📂 DSP_Assignment_01: Discrete-Time Signal AnalysisAuthors: Angel Pozos & Andrés SilverioCourse: Digital Signal Processing (2026-2)🚀 Project OverviewThis repository contains the computational implementation and theoretical verification of Discrete-Time (DT) signals. The main goal was to bridge the gap between analytical "pen-and-paper" exercises and algorithmic execution using Python, ensuring a deep understanding of signal manipulation.🛠️ Technical ImplementationUnlike standard implementations, this project emphasizes low-level logic:Manual Algorithms: Correlation and signal shifts were developed using nested loops and basic indexing to avoid high-level "black-box" functions like np.convolve or np.correlate.Signal Synthesis: Generation of fundamental sequences: Unit Impulse ($\delta[n]$), Unit Step ($u[n]$), and Unit Ramp ($r[n]$).Characterization: Precise calculation of Energy ($E_x$), Average Power ($P_x$), Mean, and RMS values for various sequences.🧪 Key Lab TopicsSampling & Aliasing: Practical demonstration of the Nyquist-Shannon theorem and how frequency folding occurs when $f_s < 2f_{max}$.Signal Periodicity: Mathematical and visual determination of fundamental periods ($N$) in sinusoidal sequences.Correlation Analysis: Comparative study between Autocorrelation (signal symmetry) and Cross-correlation (similarity between different sequences).💻 StackLanguage: Python 3.xEnvironment: Jupyter NotebookCore Libraries: NumPy (array handling), Matplotlib (signal visualization).📝 How to useClone the repository.Open PozosSilverio_Tarea1.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code.
